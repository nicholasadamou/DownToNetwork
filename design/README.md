## ü§î What is '_Down To Network_'?

This project was created for the Summer IBM HackCIO event, where fellow IBM interns in groups of 4 had 24 hours to design and construct an app that would improve IBM in one of the following categories:

1. Inclusion
2. Community Building
3. Environmental Friendly
4. Onboarding Process

üèÜ **_DownToNetwork_** **won** under the category **_Community Building_** and voted **_Most likely to be used at IBM_**.

DownToNetwork is a dynamic web / mobile app optimized to connect new fellow IBMers to experienced IBMers through the power of matching.

## üßê Problem Statement

Many of our co-workers at IBM have mentioned how difficult it is to meet talented individuals outside of their respective teams.

## üí° Idea / Solution

We designed the app to have a "tinder-like" feel where you sign up and create an account and tell the application about yourself and your intentions. The application uses an algorithm designed to connect users based on their role at IBM (Intern, manager, etc) and the types of people that they would like to meet. Once a user is signed up, they are presented with the home page where they are able to swipe right or left on each individual that the app deems you'd find interesting enough to network with. Once you 'match' with an individual, the application rightfully says, for example, 'Ginni is Down To Network!' and presents a match screen where you can email the individual.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations

Since the app does not integrate with IBM w3, the application requires already on-boarded IBMer's to sign up though the app itself.

## üöÄ Future Scope

The application can continue to evolve in the following ways:

    - Add a calendar feature that allows user's to block time on a calendar to meet those who they have matched with through the app.
    - A messaging feature that allows matched users to chat with others they matched with.

## üìö The Design Stack

This project uses the following technologies:

- [**Carbon Design System**](https://carbondesignsystem.com) - Carbon is the design system for IBM web and product. It is a series of individual styles, components, and guidelines used for creating unified UI.
- [**Sketch**](https://www.sketch.com/) - Create, prototype, collaborate and turn your ideas into incredible products with the definitive platform for digital design.
- [**Abstract**](https://www.abstract.com/) - Use Abstract to manage, collaborate and version your Sketch files. Our version control for designers supports a modern design workflow.
- [**Invision**](https://www.invisionapp.com/) - InVision is the digital product design platform used to make the world's best customer experiences.

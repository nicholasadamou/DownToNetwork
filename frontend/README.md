## What is '_Down To Network_'?

This project was created for the Summer IBM HackCIO event, where fellow IBM interns in groups of 4 had 24 hours to design and construct an app that would improve IBM in one of the following categories:

1. Inclusion
2. Community Building
3. Environmental Friendly
4. Onboarding Process.

DownToNetwork is a dynamic web / mobile app optimized to connect new fellow IBMers to experienced IBMers through the power of matching.
